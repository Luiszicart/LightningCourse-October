/**
 * Image plugin
 *
 * @remarks
 * The standard way of displaying images in Lightning is to just specify the src. This is the preferred way
 * for local assets (such as background, splash screen, logo and icons) of Lightning Apps.
 *
 * It is recommended that you optimize the local assets of your App by resizing them to the exact size and
 * quality in which you will use them. This positively affects the memory usage of your App.
 *
 * However, if you donâ€™t have control over the images to be displayed in your App (for example, because they
 * originate from a remote API), you can use the Image plugin to resize and crop them.
 *
 * See [Image](https://lightningjs.io/docs/#/lightning-sdk-reference/plugins/image?id=image)
 * for more information.
