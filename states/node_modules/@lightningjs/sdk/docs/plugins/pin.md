# Pin

The *Pin* plugin adds an abstraction layer to the STB's Pin functionality.

You can use the interface to check the middleware layer for the current state of the STB: *locked* or *unlocked*. You can also use it to submit a Pin code from your App to unlock the device.

Depending on the  state of the STB, you can use the Pin plugin to lock certain content or screens in your App.

> Starting <i>v5.0.0</i> and up, the Pin plugin is part of the <b>metrological-sdk</b>.<br /><br />For backwards compatibility reasons, the Lightning-SDK exports this plugin provided by the metrological-sdk.
