# TV

The *TV* plugin serves as an abstraction layer to the *live TV* functionality of an STB. The interface gives access to the current channel
and program information, and allows you to change the TV channel from *inside* an App (if your App is *whitelisted* for that purpose).

One of the things you can do with the TV plugin, is adapting your App contextually to what the user is currently watching on TV.

> Starting <i>v5.0.0</i> and up, the TV plugin is part of the <b>metrological-sdk</b>.<br /><br />For backwards compatibility reasons, the Lightning-SDK exports this plugin provided by the metrological-sdk. The code however is maintained <a href="https://github.com/Metrological/metrological-sdk" target="_blank">here</a>. More information on how to use this plugin can be found <a href="https://github.com/Metrological/metrological-sdk/blob/master/docs/plugins/tv.md" target="_blank">here</a>.
