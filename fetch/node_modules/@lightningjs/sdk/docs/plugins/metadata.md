# Metadata

If you create an App, you store the App's *metadata* (such as its name, version and icon) in the file **metadata.json**.

The Metadata plugin enables you to use this metadata in your App. (For example, if you want to show the App's version number in an *About* window.)

> Starting <i>v5.0.0</i> and up, the Metadata plugin is part of the <b>metrological-sdk</b>.<br /><br />For backwards compatibility reasons, the Lightning-SDK exports this plugin provided by the metrological-sdk. The code however is maintained <a href="https://github.com/Metrological/metrological-sdk" target="_blank">here</a>. More information on how to use this plugin can be found <a href="https://github.com/Metrological/metrological-sdk/blob/master/docs/plugins/metadata.md" target="_blank">here</a>.
