# Purchase

You can use the Purchase plugin to integrate *in-app purchases* in your App, in combination with the Metrological Billing Server. This way, you can let customers perform transactions in Apps, and the customers can pay for the transactions via the operatorâ€™s monthly bill.

> Starting <i>v5.0.0</i> and up, the Purchase plugin is part of the <b>metrological-sdk</b>.<br /><br />For backwards compatibility reasons, the Lightning-SDK exports this plugin provided by the metrological-sdk. The code however is maintained <a href="https://github.com/Metrological/metrological-sdk" target="_blank">here</a>. More information on how to use this plugin can be found <a href="https://github.com/Metrological/metrological-sdk/blob/master/docs/plugins/pin.md" target="_blank">here</a>.
